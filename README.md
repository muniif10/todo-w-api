# todo-w-api
This is my small project to create a Todo list API that implements Jester for unit testing. The coverage given by jester is 100% but I haven't produced the frontend to interact with this little API (it is just ExpressJS)
To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.32. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
